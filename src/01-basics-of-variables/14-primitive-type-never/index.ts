/**

/**
 * However, when all types of a union or enum cause the code to return something other than never,
 *   the compiler wonâ€™t complain. Using never is helpful when code around multiple type
 *   values evolve. When an option is added, for example, to a union or enum, TypeScript will
 *   compute that the function can return never and not compile. Since version 2.0,
 * TypeScript can find out if the code was entered in the default case (or with else case if
 *   you are not using the switch statement).

 * This insight of TypeScript is perfect since the function return type only accepts a string
 *   and does not accept never. If in the future you add a new item from enum,
 *   (for example, a ChoiceC, without adding a new case in the switch statement), then,
 *   the code can call the unhandledChoice function which returns never.
