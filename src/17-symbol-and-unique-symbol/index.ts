/**
 * TypeScript strongly types the primitive type, symbol, and its subtype, unique symbol.

/**
 * Symbol
 */

/**
 * Symbol is a primitive type in ECMAScript 2015 and beyond. TypeScript supports the standard.
 * The equal sign assigns a value to a symbol without the keyword new but must have parentheses,
 *   like an object. A symbol's goal is to provide a unique and immutable variable.
 */

/**
 * A symbol can take a parameter with a string value. Defining two symbols with the same parameter
 *   will produce a different symbol. In fact, the parameter is just there to help developers when
 *   printing the symbol to the console. It's a way to differentiate them visually.
 */

/**
 * The main difference between a constant and a symbol is that the symbol is unique. With a string
 *   constant, someone could pass a string with the same value as the constant and it would be
 *   accepted. However, using a constant symbol, only the same symbol constant would equal that value.
 * Nothing can coerce a symbol into a string. This means that you cannot add a string to it and
 *   expect it to become a string.
 */

  console.log("Equal when string");  // This will print
}

  console.log("Equal when symbol");  // This will not print, they are not equal
}

/**
 * An object property can be a symbol. Its assignment uses the symbol between brackets.
 * Do keep in mind that a property defined with a symbol wonâ€™t appear when you invoke
 *   Object.defineProperty or Object.getOwnPropertyNames.

/**
 * Unique symbol
 */

/**
 * A unique symbol can only be defined with the use of const or readonly static.
 *   A unique symbol is used to create a literal type that cannot be of another symbol.
 *   Hence, the type is not symbol but a symbol with a unique identity.
 */

/**
 * Consider that a string can be a string variable or a string literal.
 *   Hovering over the first variable of the following code shows that it is type string,
 *   while the type of the second variable is Value3.
